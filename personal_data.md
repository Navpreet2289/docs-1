### Update your personal data

If you are a bot developer and you want to update your username and/or your email address, click your avatar at the top right of the page in SAP Conversational AI and choose **Settings**.

<br/>

### Delete your account

**Caution:** All bots that you created with this account will also be deleted, except for bots that you created from within an organization if there are still members of that organization (including another administrator). If there are still members of the organization, and you are the sole administrator, you must first make another member an administrator before you can delete your account.

If you are a bot developer and you want to delete your account, click your avatar at the top right of the page in SAP Conversational AI, choose **Settings**, and then click **DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT**.

<br/>

### Access or delete bot user's personal data

-   Name of the channel used to access the bot

SAP CoPilot doesn't store the end-userâ€™s conversation with the assistant beyond the UI session.

In addition, at any point the user can go to the SAP CoPilot settings and perform a clear assistant activity to delete/clear the conversations. Alternatively, the user can get a report about their personal data stored, as documented in <a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/5fc83c01bbdc4999b6bb8b915f395b7f/1811/en-US/f4b33e88f2b4414bb48f51d168a4f2e4.html" target="_blank" >User Offboarding</a> in the SAP CoPilot User Help. That report also offers a function for the user to entirely offboard SAP CoPilot; this would also delete the conversations with the assistant.
