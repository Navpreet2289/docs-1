## Definition
An intent is a **box** of expressions that mean the same thing but are constructed in different ways. Intents are the heart of your bot's understanding.
Each one of your intents represents an idea your bot is able to understand.

## Tips

* Make sure your intents are **distinct** enough to avoid misunderstandings and unnecessary confusion
* **Balance** your intents: try to have the same amount of expressions in each of them
* **Diversify** your intents: use as many different grammatical structures as you can

## Example
You want your bot to understand when someone asks for help. Just create an intent called \`help\` and fill it with every expression a user would say when asking for guidance.

* Could you help me?
* Iâ€™m lost, give me a hand please.
* Can you help?
* What can you do for me?
