We currently detect 4 acts of a sentence, as defined in the section 8.7 of <a target="_blank" href='ftp://ftp.cs.sjtu.edu.cn:990/lu-rz/natural%20language%20understanding%20book/1~9.pdf'>Natural Language Understanding, 1995, James Allen</a>.
Those 4 categories are defined as surface speech acts, which indicate how the proposition described is intended to be used to update the discourse situation.

| Type | Examples | Description |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `assert` | The man ate a peach. | The proposition is being asserted |
| `command` | Eat a peach. | The proposition describes an action to perform |
| `wh-query` | What did the man eat? | The proposition describes an object to be identified |
| `yn-query` | Did the man eat a peach? | The proposition is being queried |
