Sentiment detection is an important part of analyzing an user's input. We decided to follow guidelines suggesting a higher granularity of sentiments that you may be used to.
This allows you to treat different levels of positive, and negative inputs .

| Polarity | Examples |
| -------- | -------- |
| `vpositive` | That was awesome to see that man eat a peach. |
| `positive` | The man ate a peach. |
| `neutral` | peach. |
| `negative` | Sadly, the man did not eat a peach. |
| `vnegative` | That was awful to see this man ate a peach. |
